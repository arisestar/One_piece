  <p><strong>Eiichiro Oda</strong>, born January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan, is a professional mangaka, best known as the creator of the manga One Piece.

  A dedicated writer and artist since adolescence, Oda began working for Shueisha's Shonen Jump at 17 and currently stands as one of the world's most prominent mangaka, earning an estimated ¥3.1 billion (US$26 million) per year.[3] Despite his rigorous work schedule, he maintains steady correspondence with fans (and the wider public) through both formal interviews and informal channels such as his SBS columns.

  He is married to Chiaki Inaba, with whom he has two daughters.</p>
  

    <p>As a child, Oda read many different manga (the earliest he can recall being The Monster Kid). These - along with his father's oil-painting hobby - inspired his dream to become a mangaka, as he believed they made money for doing no "real" work. His favorite television show was Vicky the Viking, a European-coproduced anime which began his lifelong fascination with pirates.

  In fifth grade, inspired by Weekly Shonen Jump bestseller Captain Tsubasa, he joined his school's soccer club. It was around this time that Jump began serializing Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball; on reading its second chapter, Oda was instantly enthralled, and would be heavily influenced by Toriyama's art and storytelling sensibilities for years to come.

  Oda began drawing manga in earnest around his second year of junior high, developing ideas and sketches for a pirate serial that would, many years later, become One Piece.During his first year of high school, he chose to quit soccer so he could focus wholly on manga.

  Breakthrough: Wanted! (1992-1993)Edit
  In 1992, during his senior year of high school, the seventeen-year-old Oda took interest in Shueisha's prestigious Tezuka Awards. Having enjoyed Westerns since seeing Young Guns some time prior, he spent four months constructing his first full-length manga: Wanted!, a "Gag Western" with strong supernatural elements. Proud of his work, but concerned his parents and teachers might disapprove, he submitted it under the pseudonym Tsuki Himizu Kikondo (月火水木金土?).

  Ultimately, Wanted! was named Second Class (準入選 Jun-nyūsen?) in the 44th Tezuka Awards, alongside two other works. This won Oda a ¥500,000 cash prize and recognition from many industry professionals, and in early 1993 his work was published in Shueisha's ongoing Mezase Mangaka! (めざせ漫画家!?) series.Around this time, Oda - under his real name - acceded to his first professional interview, published in Kumamoto City's most prominent newspaper.

  In spring of 1993, Oda graduated high school and entered Kyushu Tokai University's architecture program. Soon after, he began submitting more work to Shueisha, unaware that his Tezuka honors had qualified him not for Weekly Shonen Jump, but its Monthly offshoot. On finding his next publication - God's Gift for the Future - in the Monthly line, he sought out the Weekly title's "proper" channel, the somewhat less-renowned Hop☆Step Awards. That October, his Hop☆Step entry Ikki Yako won first place — his first unqualified success as a mangaka.

Professional CareerEdit
In early 1994, encouraged by the honors his manga had received (and dreading his freshman exams), Oda dropped out of Kyushu Tokai to pursue a mangaka career in Tokyo, under the authority of editor Kaoru Kushima.

Assistant Years (1994-1997)Edit
Like most mangaka, Oda began his professional career as an assistant for established Shonen Jump creators. His first assistant work was for the last few chapters of Shinobu Kaitani's Midoriyama Police Gang; though only a month long, this tenure gave Oda his first experience with professional manga production, and he cited the sheer beauty of the final drafts (always diminished by Jump's cheap print) as an important inspiration.

After Kaitani left Jump, Oda spent some eighteen months assisting Masaya Tokuhiro through the final year of Jungle King Tar-chan and most of Tokuhiro's subsequent series Kappaman. This was his longest tenure under any single mangaka, and he (despite Tokuhiro's noted reluctance to leave any significant work to assistants) developed much of his technique drafting backgrounds and crowds for both series.[13]

Simultaneously, Oda conceived many more drafts for his own manga, almost all of which were rejected by Kushima. Though their relationship remained civil, Oda did not take Kushima's many criticisms to heart until his one-shot Monsters was allowed publication in 1994's Shonen Jump Autumn Special. Reading his own work at a remove allowed Oda to recognize many of his artistic inadequacies, spurring him to improve.

Once Kappaman ended in mid-1996, Oda began his final assistant tenure, under Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin. Watsuki, apart from being one of Jump's most popular new creators, was somewhat more easygoing than Tokuhiro and allowed his assistants greater participation in his work; Oda in particular was credited with conceptualizing the crossdressing swordsman Honjō Kamatari.

However, despite enjoying the atmosphere - and making many new friends - at Watsuki's studio, Oda remained troubled by all the rejections his independent drafts were still facing. Finally, in a "last-resort" bid for publication, he developed the pirate serial he had conceptualized since high school into a draft titled Romance Dawn. To his relief, Romance Dawn impressed Kushima enough to approve further development, and was soon published in that year's Shonen Jump Summer Special, to general praise from readers.

Almost concurrent with Romance Dawn's publication, Oda fell under the purview of a new editor, Takanori Asada, who arranged for him to fill an upcoming gap in Weekly Shonen Jump. Seizing this extremely rare opportunity, Oda produced a second Romance Dawn draft within two weeks, and saw it published to renewed acclaim. Despite this, Asada's superiors remained skeptical of the concept and repeatedly refused to serialize it, forcing Asada to argue on Oda's behalf for several months.

In May of 1997, One Piece was finally approved for serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump, and Oda formally resigned as Watsuki's assistant to begin his career as a full-fledged mangaka.

One Piece (1997-Present)Edit
For Oda, constructing the first chapters of One Piece was relatively straightforward. Knowing Jump customarily gave any new serial around ten installments to gauge reader response, he (with Asada's help) refined the earlier portions of his concept material into eight chapters: seven for a largely self-contained "introduction" arc, and one beginning a second, more elaborate arc.

In July of 1997, Weekly Shonen Jump #34 premiered the first of these chapters, once again titled Romance Dawn. To Oda's surprise - and delight - it ranked higher in fan response than any of its co-features, prefiguring the series' runaway success. In following years, One Piece would expand into a considerable franchise, receiving its first animated adaptation in 1998, a full-length anime series in 1999, and its first video game in 2000.

In 2002, Oda met Chiaki Inaba, who played Nami during the Shonen Jump Festa, and the two started going out, and in 2004, they got married. In 2006, he and his wife had a daughter. In April 2006, Oda unexpectedly fell ill and One Piece was not released that week. However he recovered and resumed One Piece the next week. Because of his recent illness, Oda felt the fans needed to catch up so he created Grand Line Times.

In 2007, at the JUMP Fiesta 2008, in the absence of Shūichi Ikeda, when the voice actors acted out the Red-Hair of Class 3 - Sea Time short, he wore a hot pink wig for the part and explained he would only do this because One Piece was in its tenth year.[26]

He was also involved in writing and directing the tenth One Piece movie, the first movie that he actually wrote the script for, in honor of the tenth anniversary of One Piece.

In 2011, after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, Oda as well as other mangaka drew messages to the victims.
FutureEdit
Oda stated in One Piece Blue that he wanted to create a robot manga after he finished One Piece.However, he later stated that he would never draw any more long-runners because his physical health could not stand it.</p>
